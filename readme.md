# Notes

I had been meaning to message a friend for a while and unfortunately he's a bit far for the hope of a postcard reaching him. So I decided to make a digital one with a card flip animation. It was cool to learn how to do that and got some good practice with CSS.

The template is intended to be filled out for the desired recipient.
